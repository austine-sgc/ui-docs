## Policies

### Business Compromise

The Business Compromise policy monitors all messages on several indicators that may indicate a compromise within the business. 

#### Phishing 
Phishing is a form of cyber attack where attackers impersonate legitimate individuals, organizations, or entities through deceptive emails, messages, or websites. The goal of phishing is to trick recipients into divulging sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, or financial details. Phishing attacks often employ social engineering tactics to manipulate users into clicking malicious links, downloading malware-infected attachments, or providing confidential information, thereby compromising the security and privacy of individuals or organizations.

#### Spear Phishing 
Spear Phishing is a targeted form of cyber attack where attackers personalize their phishing attempts to specific individuals or organizations. Unlike traditional phishing, which casts a wide net to a large number of potential victims, spear phishing involves researching the intended targets to craft highly customized and convincing messages. These messages often appear to come from trusted sources, such as colleagues, business partners, or acquaintances, making them more likely to deceive the recipient. Spear phishing attacks may leverage information obtained from social media, public databases, or previous breaches to enhance their credibility and increase the likelihood of success. This method of attack aims to trick recipients into disclosing sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading malware, thereby enabling the attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or steal valuable data.

#### Water Hole Attack
Water Hole Attack is a sophisticated cyber attack strategy that targets a specific group of individuals or organizations by compromising websites they are likely to visit frequently, akin to predators lying in wait near watering holes frequented by prey in the wild. In a water hole attack, attackers identify websites regularly accessed by their intended victims, such as industry forums, social media platforms, or news sites, and inject malicious code or malware into these legitimate websites. When users visit these compromised websites, their devices may become infected with malware or be redirected to phishing pages designed to steal their credentials or sensitive information. By exploiting the trust users place in familiar websites, water hole attacks can effectively compromise the security of targeted individuals or organizations, potentially leading to data breaches, financial losses, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#### Supply Chain Attack
Supply Chain Attack is a type of cyber attack that targets the interconnected network of suppliers, vendors, and service providers associated with an organization. Instead of directly attacking the target organization's systems or infrastructure, attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the supply chain to gain unauthorized access or compromise the integrity of the target's systems or data. 

In a supply chain attack, attackers may infiltrate and compromise the systems or software of a trusted supplier or vendor, often through tactics like malware injection, credential theft, or software supply chain manipulation. Once compromised, the attackers can leverage the trusted relationship between the supplier and the target organization to distribute malware, exfiltrate sensitive data, or launch further attacks deeper into the target's network.

Supply chain attacks can have widespread and cascading effects, potentially impacting multiple organizations across various sectors. These attacks highlight the importance of comprehensive cybersecurity measures, including thorough vetting of suppliers and vendors, implementing robust security protocols, and monitoring for suspicious activity throughout the supply chain ecosystem.

#### Social Engineering
Social engineering is a deceptive technique used by cyber attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information, providing unauthorized access, or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike traditional hacking methods that target technical vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits psychological factors, human trust, and interpersonal relationships to deceive victims.

Common forms of social engineering include:

1. Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details.

2. Spear Phishing: A targeted form of phishing that tailors messages to specific individuals or organizations, often using personal information to increase credibility and effectiveness.

3. Pretexting: Creating a fabricated scenario or pretext to gain a victim's trust and extract information or access privileges. This may involve impersonating a trusted entity, such as a colleague or service provider.

4. Baiting: Offering something enticing, such as a free download or prize, to lure victims into clicking on malicious links or downloading malware-infected files.

5. Impersonation: Pretending to be someone else, either in person, over the phone, or online, to manipulate individuals into providing sensitive information or granting access.

Social engineering attacks rely on exploiting human psychology and emotions, such as curiosity, fear, or urgency, to bypass technical security measures and achieve the attacker's objectives. Effective defense against social engineering requires awareness training, skepticism, and adherence to security best practices, such as verifying identities and avoiding sharing sensitive information without proper authentication.

#### Call to Action
A "Call to Action" (CTA) in the context of cybersecurity refers to a prompt or instruction designed to encourage specific security-related behavior or response from individuals or organizations. CTAs are commonly used in security awareness campaigns, training materials, or incident response protocols to prompt users to take proactive measures or respond appropriately to security threats.

Examples of cybersecurity CTAs include:

1. "Report Suspicious Emails": Encouraging users to report any suspicious or phishing emails they receive to the IT security team for further investigation.

2. "Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)": Urging users to enable MFA to add an extra layer of security to their accounts and protect against unauthorized access.

3. "Update Software and Applications": Reminding users to regularly update their software and applications to patch known vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk of exploitation by attackers.

4. "Practice Strong Password Hygiene": Advising users to create complex, unique passwords and avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts to enhance security.

By prioritizing urgency and taking swift action, organizations can effectively safeguard their digital assets, maintain trust with stakeholders, and uphold their reputation for security excellence.

#### Data Exfiltration
Data exfiltration, also known as data extrusion, refers to the unauthorized transfer or theft of sensitive or confidential data from a computer system, network, or organization. In a cybersecurity context, data exfiltration typically involves malicious actors gaining access to valuable information, such as intellectual property, customer data, financial records, or trade secrets, and surreptitiously transmitting it to external locations or adversaries' systems.

Data exfiltration can occur through various methods, including:

1. File Transfer: Attackers may use file transfer protocols or remote access tools to copy sensitive files or documents from compromised systems to external servers or cloud storage.

2. Network Communication: Malware or malicious scripts installed on compromised devices can establish covert communication channels with command-and-control servers controlled by attackers, allowing them to transmit stolen data over the network without detection.

3. Email or Web-based Uploads: Attackers may use phishing attacks or malware-infected attachments to trick users into unwittingly uploading sensitive data to malicious websites or email servers under their control.

4. Physical Media: In some cases, attackers may physically steal or compromise storage devices, such as USB drives or external hard disks, to extract data from targeted systems.

Data exfiltration poses significant risks to organizations, including financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance, and legal consequences. To prevent and detect data exfiltration attempts, organizations employ a range of cybersecurity measures, such as implementing access controls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, data loss prevention solutions, and security monitoring tools to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities indicative of data exfiltration. Additionally, regular security assessments, employee training, and incident response planning are essential to mitigate the impact of data exfiltration incidents and enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.

#### Ransomware / Malware 
Ransomware and malware are both types of malicious software, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:
##### Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware designed to encrypt files or lock down computer systems, rendering them inaccessible to users. Once the malware encrypts the victim's files, the attacker demands a ransom payment, typically in cryptocurrency, in exchange for providing the decryption key or unlocking the system. Ransomware attacks often involve threats of data loss, system disruption, or exposure of sensitive information if the ransom is not paid within a specified timeframe. Ransomware can spread through various vectors, including phishing emails, malicious websites, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software or networks.

##### Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is a broad category of software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Malware encompasses a wide range of malicious programs, including viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Malware can perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, corrupting files, hijacking system resources, conducting denial-of-service attacks, or providing remote access to attackers. Malware infections can occur through various attack vectors, such as email attachments, software downloads, malicious links, removable media, or exploiting software vulnerabilities.

In summary, ransomware is a specific type of malware that encrypts files or locks down systems to extort ransom payments from victims, while malware refers to a broader category of malicious software designed to cause harm or compromise computer systems and networks. Ransomware is a subset of malware, and both pose significant threats to cybersecurity and require robust defenses, such as antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and regular software updates, to prevent and mitigate their impact.

#### Advanced Persistence Threats
"Advanced Persistent Threats" (APTs) are sophisticated and stealthy cyber attacks orchestrated by highly skilled threat actors, typically state-sponsored groups, organized cybercriminals, or advanced hacking collectives. APTs are characterized by their persistence, meaning that attackers remain undetected within a targeted network for extended periods, often months or even years, while quietly exfiltrating data, conducting reconnaissance, and maintaining access to compromised systems.

Key attributes of Advanced Persistent Threats include:

1. **Sophistication**: APTs employ advanced techniques, including zero-day exploits, custom malware, and evasion tactics, to bypass traditional security defenses and evade detection by security measures.

2. **Long-Term Focus**: Unlike opportunistic attacks that seek immediate gains, APTs are typically part of a long-term strategic campaign aimed at achieving specific objectives, such as espionage, intellectual property theft, or sabotage.

3. **Stealth and Persistence**: APT actors use stealthy techniques to remain hidden within the target environment, such as avoiding detection by antivirus software, masquerading as legitimate users, and encrypting communication channels to evade monitoring.

4. **Targeted Approach**: APTs selectively target high-value organizations or individuals, such as government agencies, defense contractors, multinational corporations, or research institutions, based on their strategic importance or access to valuable information.

5. **Adaptability**: APT actors continuously adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to circumvent evolving security defenses, exploit new vulnerabilities, or bypass detection mechanisms.

6. **Multi-Stage Attacks**: APT campaigns often involve multiple stages, including initial compromise, reconnaissance, lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistent access for future exploitation.

Given their complexity and sophistication, defending against Advanced Persistent Threats requires a multi-layered security approach, including robust network perimeter defenses, endpoint protection, intrusion detection and prevention systems, security analytics, threat intelligence sharing, employee training, and incident response planning. Additionally, organizations must remain vigilant, regularly assess their security posture, and stay informed about emerging threats to effectively mitigate the risk posed by APTs.

#### Credential Dumping 
Credential dumping is a technique used by attackers to obtain and harvest user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, from compromised systems. This method is commonly employed during cyber attacks, especially in the later stages of the attack lifecycle, to escalate privileges, gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, or move laterally within a network.

Here's how credential dumping typically works:

1. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or services running on target systems to gain initial access. This could involve techniques like exploiting software vulnerabilities, leveraging weak passwords, or phishing attacks.

2. **Obtaining Access**: Once inside a target system, attackers seek to escalate their privileges and gain deeper access to the system or network. They may exploit misconfigurations, insecure defaults, or known vulnerabilities in the operating system or installed software to elevate their privileges.

3. **Dumping Credentials**: With elevated privileges, attackers use various techniques to extract stored credentials from the compromised system's memory or credential stores. This can include accessing password hashes stored in the Windows Security Account Manager (SAM) database, extracting plaintext passwords stored in memory, or capturing authentication tokens.

4. **Harvesting Credentials**: The extracted credentials are then harvested and collected by the attackers. This could include usernames, passwords, authentication tokens, or other forms of authentication data.

5. **Credential Reuse or Theft**: Attackers can then reuse the harvested credentials to gain unauthorized access to other systems, services, or accounts within the network. Alternatively, they may sell stolen credentials on the dark web or use them for further malicious activities, such as identity theft or financial fraud.

Credential dumping poses a significant security risk as it allows attackers to obtain sensitive authentication information, bypass access controls, and escalate their privileges within a compromised environment. To defend against credential dumping attacks, organizations should implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular credential hygiene practices, privileged access management (PAM), and monitor for suspicious activities indicative of credential misuse or abuse. Additionally, keeping systems and software up to date with the latest security patches can help mitigate the risk of exploitation by attackers.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework consists of several components:

1. **Tactics**: High-level categories representing the overall objectives or goals of cyber adversaries. The current ATT&CK framework includes tactics such as Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.

2. **Techniques**: Specific methods or procedures used by adversaries to achieve each tactic's objectives. Techniques provide detailed descriptions of adversary behavior, tools, procedures, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with each tactic. For example, techniques under the Initial Access tactic may include Spear Phishing, External Remote Services, or Exploit Public-Facing Application.

3. **Sub-Techniques**: Further refinements of techniques that provide additional granularity and detail regarding adversary behavior. Sub-techniques help to differentiate between variations or specific implementations of a technique. For example, a sub-technique of the Execution technique might specify a particular command-line interface or scripting language used by adversaries.

4. **Mitigations**: Recommended countermeasures, best practices, or security controls that organizations can implement to detect, prevent, or mitigate the impact of adversary tactics and techniques. Mitigations provide guidance on improving cybersecurity posture and resilience against cyber threats.

MITRE ATT&CK is widely used by cybersecurity professionals, threat intelligence analysts, incident responders, and security vendors to enhance threat detection, response, and mitigation capabilities. By leveraging the ATT&CK framework, organizations can better understand the tactics and techniques employed by adversaries, assess their security posture, prioritize defensive measures, and develop effective strategies to defend against cyber threats.
