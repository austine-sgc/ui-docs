The Search Page allows users to search and refine results. 
## Usage

`Date` -  Arranges items based on their creation dates, with the default order showing the most recent items first. Selecting this filter toggles the sorting order to display the 'Invalid Date' and last created items first. 

`Date Range` - Allows users to specify a period of time to filter search items falling within the range. 

`Sender` - Allows users to search the 'Sender' column data. 

`Recipients` - Allows users to search 'Recipients' column data.

`Channel` - Allows users to search 'Channel' column data. 

`Content` - Allows users to search through the content of messages.

### Search Filtering

When filtering through any of the column data there are two keywords that can be applied to further refine search results. 

`AND` - When searching includes both the first and second query in the returned search content. 
**e.g.** Searching for Gemini AND Google in content will return message content containing both 'Gemini' and 'Google' in the results. 

`OR` - When searching content in either the first and second query will be returned. 
**e.g** Search for Gemini OR Google in content will return messages that contain either Gemini or Google across separate messages.
